													<h4>EarNet: Biometric Embeddings for End to End Person Authentication System Using Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emission Signal</h4>
													<p>Journal: Neural Processing Letters | Springer | Status: Paper Accepted</p>
												</header>
												<p style='text-align: justify;'>
													Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions (TEOAE) are a class of otoacoustic emissions 
													that are generated by the cochlea in response to an external													
													stimulus. The TEOAE signals exhibit characteristics unique to an individual, and
													are therefore considered as a potential biometric modality. Unlike conventional													
													modalities, TEOAE is immune to replay and falsification attacks due to its implicit liveliness detection feature. In this paper, we propose an efficient deep neural													
													network architecture, EarNet, to learn the appropriate filters for non-stationary													
													(TEOAE) signals, which can reveal individual uniqueness and long-term reproducibility. EarNet is inspired by Google’s FaceNet. Furthermore, the embeddings													
													generated by EarNet, in the Euclidean space, are such that they reduce intrasubject variability while capturing inter-subject variability, as visualized using													
													t-SNE. The embeddings from EarNet are used for identification and verification
													tasks. The K-Nearest Neighbour classifier gives <b>identification accuracies of 99.21%
													and 99.42% for the left and right ear</b>, respectively, which are highest among the
													machine learning algorithms explored in this work. The verification using Pearson
													correlation on the embeddings performs with an <b>EER of 0.581% and 0.057% for
													the left and right ear</b>, respectively, scoring better than all other techniques. <b>Fusion
													strategy yields an improved identification accuracy of 99.92%</b>. The embeddings
													generalize well on subjects that are not part of the training, and hence EarNet is
													scalable on any new larger dataset.

													<h4>H. U. B - Eye, Hearing using Bone Conduction and seeing through DNN</h4>
													<p>Conference: International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communications (ADCOM 2018)</p>
												</header>
												<p style='text-align: justify;'>
													The paper proposes a device capable of making the
													lives of visually impaired easier. The device encompasses an image
													recognition using deep learning (convolutional neural network)
													unit coupled with the novel idea of the bone conduction system,
													which can be mounted on the sunglasses of the visually impaired.
													The whole process allows two-channel hearing enabling people
													to hear regular as well as the intended audio. Instead of air, the
													sound is propagated through the bone in the form of vibration
													and is sent to cochlea through a membrane. The proposed
													system takes an image from a mounted camera, classifies it
													with a dedicated processor and sends the audio signal through a
													Bluetooth channel to the bone conduction transducer so that the
													user can hear through the system what is in front of him. The
													system is able to recognize the input image using deep learning
													and give an audio output directly to the eardrum of the user.

												I have developed huge passion for <strong>Tennis</strong> from elementary school days by knocking tennis balls on the walls of the house for several hours 
												and breaking few of mom's favourite crockery, followed by being reprimand for the same (But, I never stopped though! &#128540;) . My Tennis ideal

												ended being second most favourite sport. I even ended up getting a <a href="https://ratings.fide.com/profile/5083346">1335</a> as FIDE rating. I was more focused on enjoying the game rather than wining 
												or losing during Chess tournaments. These day's I don't play open tournaments but I do play Chess Online time to time. For Accomplishments in Chess, 
												I have won a Zonal and some state level competitions in Chess during my school days.
